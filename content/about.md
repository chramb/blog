# About Me
Hello, name is Chris and I'm an author of this blog. \
curreltny I'm in the last year of engineering studies in Cybersecurity.

However in my free time the thing that takes most of my time is Linux and my Homelab striving to be as independent as possible with technologies I use while having more convenience than anybody.

# About Website
I plan to regularly post mostly tech related content about software I'm testing and hosting.
Tutorials on how to configure and use various software and services.
And document my adventures throughout self-hosting and whatever comes to my mind.
