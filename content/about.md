# About Me
Hello, name is Chris and I'm an author of this blog. \
Curreltny I'm studying Cybersecurity and in spare time I love to play around with Linux/UNIX on both desktop and server as well as trying do do some light coding.

# About the blog
I plan to regularly post mostly tech related content about software I'm testing and hosting.
Tutorials on how to configure and use various software and services.
As well as document my adventures throughout self-hosting and whatever comes to my mind and I find interesting and worth sharing.
